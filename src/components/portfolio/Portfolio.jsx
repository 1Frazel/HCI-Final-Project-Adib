    job: 'Network Engineer (Contract)',
    corporation: 'PT. Info Solusindo Data Utama',
    info: <p> This project is an implementation in improving network security at BRI offices.
          <br />
          BRI itself has 3 types of offices, there are KCP (Branch Office) at the lowest level, then there is KC (Branch Office) at the middle level, and there is KK (Regional Office) which is the center of the BRI network in the area. And in this project, my team and I were assigned to install Fortigate in several KCP and KC offices spread across Jabodetabek and Banten, and while I got an allotment to install in 9 KCP, and 1 KC.
          <br />
          <br />
          In this project, I did 3 things during the installation:  
          <br />
          1. When I first arrived at the site, what I did was survey the topology of the BRI office. There are 2 types of BRI networks, Intranet and Internet, and we must know in detail the topology of the two networks. 
          <br />
          2. Start Intranet / Internet Installation After completing the survey and analyzing the topology, then we start to start adding Fortigate devices to the network, which will later become the office's Intranet and Internet network firewall. 
          <br />
          3. Documentation after completing the installation, I check all BRI facilities, systems, and applications, as well as the internet there, whether they can be used again and the traffic has passed through Fortigate, if so then the implementation has been successful.'</p>

    title: 'Front End Engineer Internship 99 Group (2025-2026)',
    job: 'Front End Engineer Intern',
    corporation: '99 Group Indonesia',
    info: <p>
          During my a year tenure as a Frontend Engineer Intern at 99 Group (Rumah123.com), I played an integral role in the complete software development lifecycle within a fast-paced Agile Scrum environment. Operating across the Growth, Conversion, and Consumer teams, I engineered responsive, user-centric web applications utilizing Next.js and Server-Side Rendering (SSR). My core project contributions included architecting a highly scalable cross-device navigation system (HeaderV2), developing a dynamic property review section integrated with a Strapi headless CMS, and building strategic components for the New Search Result Page (NSRP) and Matchmaker tool.
          <br />
          <br />
          Beyond new feature development, I actively managed technical debt and system optimization by resolving over 120 sprint and bug tickets related to complex state management, UI inconsistencies, and advanced search filtering logic. I also spearheaded critical infrastructure and performance improvements, such as migrating visual assets to Tencent Cloud, optimizing search bar response times through debouncing, and implementing granular event-driven tracking via Segment SDK. By refining SEO breadcrumb schemas and metadata, I directly supported the platform's discoverability and technical health, ultimately delivering robust frontend solutions for one of Southeast Asia's leading property marketplaces.
